<h1>Python Notes</h1>

<h2>Primitive Types</h2>
<p>
Variables:<br>
Variables store data in a computers memory.<br>
The name of the variable can be called later in the program and it will return the value.<br>
Example:<br>

Primitive Types:<br>
-integer is a whole number like 399<br>
-float is a number with a decimal point like 11.58<br>
-boolean is a True of False statement (case sensitive). Just like Yes and No in English.<br>
-string is like text that are surrounded by quotes.<br><br>

Variable Names:<br>
Variable names need to be descriptive & meaningful.<br>
All letters are lowercase.<br>
Use underscores to seperate words.<br>
Adhere to proper formatting.<br><br>

Strings:<br>
Words surrounded by a single, double, or triple quotes.<br>
Double quotes are most commonly used.<br>
Triple quotes are used for multi-line strings.<br>
We can use built in functions.<br>
A function is a reusable piece of code that carries out a task. Similar to buttons on a remote control.<br>
A function takes an argument. For example this function outputs the length of the string:<br>

The output is 18 because the string has 18 characters in it. Spaces count as a character.<br>
To get an index of a string we use square brackets: [].<br>
The 0 index of a string is the first character.<br>
There's also negative indexes, which will start from the last character of the string.<br>
You can splice strings by using square brackets with a colon in the brackets: [:].<br>

Escape Sequences:<br>
1. \"<br>
2. \'<br>
3. \\<br>
4. \n <br>
Used for when you use a doube quote in a middle of a string that is surrounded by double quotes.<br>
 By adding the double quote in the string Python thinks the string has ended. Making everything after that invalid.<br>

To escape the in-string quotation mark we can prefix it with a \.<br>
This is called an escape character used to 'escape' the next character.<br>
In the following example the \ is an escape character and the " is an escpae sequence:<br>

If you were to add \\ to your string it would output with only 1 \:<br>

To make comments in your code that wont be used by the interpretor you prefix the comment with a #. <br>

To make a new line you use the \n.<br>

Formatted Strings:<br>
Concatenation:<br>
This is when you add two strings together by using the + operator into a new string.<br>
